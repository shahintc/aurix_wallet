## 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahintc/aurix_wallet.git
cd aurix_wallet
```

---

## 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## 4️⃣ Run the Application

Select your preferred device *(Emulator or Chrome web)* and run:

```

> **Note:** To build a production-ready Android APK, run:
>
> ```bash
> flutter build apk --release
> ```

# 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

To meet the 24-hour MVP deadline while maintaining a highly scalable codebase, the following architectural decisions were made:

---

## ⚙️ State Management (Provider)

Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. It allows for a clean separation of business logic *(currency conversions, transaction history, and balance updates)* from the UI components.

---

## 📁 Domain-Driven Folder Structure

The `lib` directory is strictly organized into:

* `screens`
* `providers`
* `widgets`
* `models`
* `theme`

This ensures the project remains maintainable as the application scales.

---

## 🧩 Custom Reusable Widgets

UI elements like `AurixCard`, `PrimaryButton`, and `AmountField` were abstracted into reusable widgets to enforce visual consistency and adhere strictly to the provided Fintech design system *(Deep Navy, Gold, and White).*

---

## 💾 In-Memory Storage

For this simulation, data is handled in-memory via the `WalletProvider`. This satisfies the core MVP requirements without the overhead of spinning up a live database.

---

# ✅ What is Completed

The following core flows have been successfully implemented and tested:

---

### 🔐 Authentication UI

Welcome and Login screens designed and fully routed.

### 📊 Dashboard

Home screen featuring an animated balance card and quick-action navigation.

### 📈 Live Market Simulation

A dynamic timer that actively simulates live gold market price fluctuations every 8 seconds, automatically updating portfolio USD values in real-time.

### 💱 Buy & Sell Logic

Full mathematical conversions between USD, Grams of Gold, and BPC *(1 BPC = 0.0001g)*, complete with validation for insufficient balances.

### 🤝 Peer-to-Peer Transfers

A Send screen allowing users to transfer BPC to email addresses or Wallet IDs.

### 🧾 Transaction Tracking

A complete History screen that securely logs all Buys, Sells, and Transfers with accurate timestamps and formatting.

---

# 🚧 What is Missing

As this is a 24-hour conceptual simulation, the following production features were intentionally deferred:

---

### 🗄️ Persistent Backend

A real database to store user credentials, wallet balances, and permanent transaction ledgers.

### 🔑 True Authentication

Integration with Firebase Auth or OAuth for secure user login and session management.

### 🌐 Live Financial APIs

Connecting to a real-world market API *(e.g., Alpha Vantage or Metalprice API)* instead of utilizing a local mathematical simulation.

### 👤 Recipient Validation

The current P2P transfer logic does not cross-reference the recipient email against a live database of registered users.

---

# 🚀 What I Would Improve with More Time

If given additional time to push this MVP to a production-ready state, I would prioritize:

---

### ☁️ Backend Integration

Connect the app to Firebase or Supabase to handle real-time data syncing, user authentication, and persistent wallet states.

### 🛡️ Enhanced Security

Implement biometric authentication *(FaceID/Fingerprint)* before allowing outgoing transactions.

### 📷 QR Code Functionality

Add the ability for users to generate and scan QR codes for frictionless, in-person BPC transfers.

### 🧪 Automated Testing

Expand the testing suite to include comprehensive widget and unit tests for the core conversion mathematics to ensure absolute financial accuracy.

### ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline

Set up GitHub Actions to automatically lint, test, and build the APK/iOS outputs upon every commit to the `main` branch.
